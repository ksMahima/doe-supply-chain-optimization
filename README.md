# Design of Experiments in Supply Chain Operations

## Overview
This project applies **Design of Experiments (DOE)** methods to evaluate how process parameters such as lead time variability, order batching, and safety stock levels affect key supply chain performance metrics.  
Using **Minitab**, factorial and regression-based DOE methods are applied to identify factor interactions and optimize inventory performance.

---

## Tools Used
- **Minitab** – DOE setup and statistical analysis  
- **Excel** – Data management and results documentation  

---

## Objectives
- Analyze the impact of process parameters on supply chain KPIs  
- Identify statistically significant factors using DOE  
- Quantify relationships between lead time, batching, and inventory turnover  

---

## Key Results
- Improved **inventory turnover by 17%**  
- Balanced service levels and carrying costs through process optimization  
- Derived regression model quantifying factor effects  

---

## Methodology
1. **Factor Selection** – Identified key variables: lead time, order size, safety stock.  
2. **Experimental Design** – Full and fractional factorial experiments in Minitab.  
3. **Analysis** – Used ANOVA and regression to quantify main and interaction effects.  
4. **Optimization** – Recommended factor settings for performance improvement.
